## VAE-based generative models

This repo is intended to reproduce some papers
on text generation with the usage of Variational
Autoencoder approach.

By now only  [Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06349) by Bowman et al.
is implemented.

Interpolation between random points in latent space:

in the past n years old 's n n stake in the first nine months of the company 's assets were n't disclosed
in the past n years old 's n n sales of $ n million or n cents a share from $ n million or $ n a share
in the past year 's edition of the company 's assets were $ n billion in the first nine months of the year
in the past year 's edition of the company 's assets were n't disclosed
in addition the company said it will redeem $ n million in the first nine months of the year
in addition the company said it will redeem $ n million in cash
in addition the company said it will be sold at $ n a share
